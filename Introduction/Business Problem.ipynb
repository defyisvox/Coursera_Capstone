According to <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/toronto-population\">World Population Review</a>, foreign-born people account for nearly half its population. The North American city celebrates its multicultural heritage with the existence of many ethnic neighborhoods. The identity of a city and its features are imprinted by its people. Toronto's economic and social background are consequently impacted by the great diversity of its population. Visible minority groups engrave their history and background into the very DNA of Toronto through their unique cuisine. "
